# GNSS codes, signals and spectrum generation for Matlab

All the contents were developed for the [passive remote sensing group (RSLab)](https://prs.upc.edu/) as a part of the [Remote Sensing Laboratory](http://www.tsc.upc.edu/en/research/rslab), a research line of the [CommmSensLab Group](http://www.tsc.upc.edu/en/research/commsenslab) at the [Signal Theory and Communications Department (TSC)](http://www.tsc.upc.edu/en) of the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/?set_language=en).

The first version of this program was uploaded in the [IEEE Remote Sensing Code Library (RSCL)](https://rscl-grss.org/) with DOI: [10.21982/M8F59K](https://rscl-grss.org/coderecord.php?id=479) 

New versions of this program may be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/danipascual/GNSS-matlab).
